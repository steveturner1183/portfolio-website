                        <p>
                        Iâ€™m not your typical graduate developer. At 30 years old, I've decided
                        to leave my current career as a construction project manager to build things in
                        a new way, with software.
                        <br></br><br></br>

                        For the last two years, I successfully balanced my full time job while pursuing
                        a second degree in Computer science to make this dream a reality.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        With my fresh perspective on the industry and the relevant knowledge I bring from
                         my seven years of project management experience, I am driven and prepared to start my next chapter
