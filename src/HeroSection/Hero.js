                        <h3>Project Manager. Developer.</h3>
                        <p>
                        Iâ€™m not your typical graduate developer. At 30 years old, I've decided
                        to leave my current career as a construction project manager to build things in
                        a new way, with software.
                        <br></br><br></br>

                        For the last two years, I have been pursuing a second degree in Computer Science 
                        while working full time to make this dream a reality.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I may be new to the industry, but I bring plenty of relevant knowledge
                        from my seven years of project management experience, and am ready to start my next chapter.
