            <p>
            Youâ€™ve probably looked at the portfolios of many skilled 
            and talented graduates, so why consider me? In addition 
            to a strong foundation in computer science, I also bring 
            the knowledge and skills one can only acquire from 
            successful completion of real world projects with real
             world teams.
