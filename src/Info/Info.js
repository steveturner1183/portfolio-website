            <h3>Diversify the talent on your team</h3>
            <p>
            With a vast array of skilled graduates, hereâ€™s why you should consider me.
            In addition to a strong foundation in computer science, I bring applied knowledge and 
            transferable skills acquired from successful completion of real world projects with real world teams
            in a different industry. Adding someone with a background different than the standard tech graduate invites
            growth to your team and its processes.
